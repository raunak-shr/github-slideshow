In simpler terms GitHub is a version control system. Its a place where you can privately make changes to your project and test them without having the risk of original project getting out of ork due to the changes. You can also have help of people from a large community of github. They will suggest changes to your project and its no on you to whether implement it or not. Currently I am learming more about GitHub and exploring its reach and accessibility. I will keep making changes to this website as I keep learning. Make sure that you check out this website from time to time. Thnaks for reading so far. Have a nice day. :)
